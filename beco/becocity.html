        <h2> <center>History of SABECO (early 1963 - Present date)</h2></center>
        <p>Saints Bede’s college Ashing-Kom was first opened on October 10th 1963 at Njinikom by his Lordship Bishop Jules   Peeters, the then Bishop of Buea   as Proprietor. Rev Father Antony Jansen was its first principal, Mr. Peter Ndey as first tutor and a student population of 35boys. The first school fess stood at twenty-five thousand (25.000FCFA ) And the Campus Life was Khaki short sleeve shirt and a pair of sandals. Although the school fess stood at 25.000FCFA, many people could not afford it.    

To overcome this difficulties, Rev. Fr. Anthony Jansen decided to put to practice the idea of credit unionism which he had acquired during his service as a war priest during the second world war. This saw the establishment of the first credit union in Cameroon at Njinikom. 

In 1964, two members of staff, Messrs Thaddeus Metoh and Atamja George were recruited meanwhile arrangements to get a permanent site for the college at Ashing were being concretized.

In September 1965, the college moved to its permanent site at Ashing where two its buildings of four rooms each had been constructed by Father Lambert Kiggins with grants from the West Cameroon government. The four rooms in the lower block served as dormitory and food store meanwhile those in in the upper block served as classrooms and science laboratory. A temporary structure of zinc and sticks served as refectory. The Principal’s house and two other buildings in the mission compound across the road were under construction.

In September 1966, Rev Fr. Tony Barnicle took over from Fr. Jansen as principal of the college and out of his wish to see the women participate in the building of the Cameroon nation just like men, he transformed the college to a co-educational institution. Which grants from the Kom-Bum Rural Council, he started the construction of the girls’ dormitory. The first girl, Josephine Kuoh-a princess from the Kom palace was admitted into the college but her stay was short-lived as she was withdrew from the college. In 1967, the first batch of girls were admitted into the college following the completion of construction work at the girls’ dormitory. The admission of the girls saw the recruitment of Nain Zita as Matron of the college.

Students admitted into the college were grouped into “Houses” named under saints (St. Rosa of Lima, St. Charles of Lwanga, St. Martin de Porres and St. Bosco). College activities such as games, cultural singing, debates, and even Sunday clean-ups were done on competitive bases.

In 1968, out of the 35 students admitted into the college in 1963, only 20 sat the G.C.E examinations and 12 passed scoring a percentage pass of 65.19%.  The others had withdrawn from the college either due to financial difficulties, academic inaptitude or had been dismissed over the years various acts of impropriety. Before the transformation of the college into a second cycle school, the best results produced was in 1957 (95.24%) and its worst was in 1982 (45.2%). Since after the transformation of the Republic of Cameroon at both the Ordinary and Advanced level G.C.E examinations. Between 1968 and 2013, the college scored 100% several times at the G.C.E Ordinary level and Advanced level. 

Apart from academic achievements, St. Bede’s college is also known for the high sense of discipline that has reigned and is still reigning in the college. It is sufficing to note that the college has jus moral fence. Punishment for cases of indiscipline range from rebukes to suspension and times dismissals.
In the area of sports, the college has become the pride of the North West Region of Cameroon though friendly encounters with sister denominational colleges in the Archdiocese of Bamenda and neighboring colleges. Apart from these encounters St. Bede’s excelled and has continued to excel in many sporting disciplines especially at the FENASSCO games. In 2013, the college represented Boyo Division honorably during the North West Regional FENASSCO finals in Bamenda. The Girls Basketball squad put up an excellent show and became the NW Regional flag bearers in the National FENASSCO games in Bertoua.  One student (Banadzem Thelma ) won a silver medal in Table Tennis at the National Level. The college is the current champions of Basketball girls and Volleyball Boys at the Catholic Games.
